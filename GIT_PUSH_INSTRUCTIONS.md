# ðŸ“‹ Manual Git Push Instructions

Since there's a permission issue with automated push, here's how to push manually:

## Option 1: Push to Your Repository

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /workspaces/bb

# Check if remote is correct
git remote -v

# If you need to change remote to your repository:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/beharkabash/bb.git

# Or if using SSH:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:beharkabash/bb.git

# Push the changes
git push origin main
```

## Option 2: Create a New Repository

If the current remote doesn't work:

```bash
# Create a new repository on GitHub named 'bb' or 'kroi-auto-center'
# Then:

cd /workspaces/bb
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/beharkabash/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 3: Use GitHub CLI

```bash
cd /workspaces/bb
gh repo create kroi-auto-center --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## Your Changes Are Committed Locally
