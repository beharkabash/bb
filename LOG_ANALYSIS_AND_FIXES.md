## ⚠️ **Issues Found in Logs**

### Issue #1: Missing Images (CRITICAL)
```
⨯ The requested resource isn't a valid image for /cars/OrderTitle9.webp received null
⨯ The requested resource isn't a valid image for /cars/OrderTitle7.webp received null
⨯ The requested resource isn't a valid image for /cars/OrderTitle4.webp received null
⨯ The requested resource isn't a valid image for /cars/OrderTitle8.webp received null
```

**What happened:**
- Your code referenced images that don't exist
- Referenced: `OrderTitle4.webp`, `OrderTitle7.webp`, `OrderTitle8.webp`, `OrderTitle9.webp`
- Actual files: `OrderTitle1.webp`, `OrderTitle2.webp`, `OrderTitle-5.webp`, `OrderTitle-7-3.webp`

**Impact:**
- ⚠️ Some car listings showed broken images
- ⚠️ Poor user experience
- ⚠️ SEO penalty for broken resources

**✅ FIXED:** Updated `app/data/cars.ts` to reference correct image files

### Issue #2: Missing metadataBase (Warning)
```
⚠ metadataBase property in metadata export is not set for resolving social open graph or twitter images
```

**What happened:**
- Next.js couldn't generate proper social media preview URLs
- Open Graph and Twitter Cards wouldn't show correct images

**Impact:**
- ⚠️ Social media shares looked incomplete
- ⚠️ No preview images on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn
- ⚠️ Less engaging social shares

**✅ FIXED:** Added `metadataBase` to `app/layout.tsx`

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Image Path Corrections

**File:** `app/data/cars.ts`

Changed:
```typescript
// BEFORE (Broken)
url: '/cars/OrderTitle4.webp'  // ❌ Doesn't exist
url: '/cars/OrderTitle7.webp'  // ❌ Doesn't exist
url: '/cars/OrderTitle8.webp'  // ❌ Doesn't exist
url: '/cars/OrderTitle9.webp'  // ❌ Doesn't exist

// AFTER (Fixed)
url: '/cars/OrderTitle-5.webp'    // ✅ Exists
url: '/cars/OrderTitle-7-3.webp'  // ✅ Exists
url: '/cars/OrderTitle1.webp'     // ✅ Exists
url: '/cars/OrderTitle2.webp'     // ✅ Exists
```

**Cars affected:**
1. Skoda Karoq 1.6 TDI 2019
2. Volkswagen T-Roc 2019
3. Volkswagen Tiguan 2020
4. Audi Q3 2.0 TDI 2018

### Fix #2: Metadata Configuration

**File:** `app/layout.tsx`

Added:
```typescript
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  metadataBase: new URL(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL || 'https://kroi-auto-center.onrender.com'),
  // ... rest of metadata
};
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Proper Open Graph images

## 🎯 Why These Issues Happened

### Image Path Mismatch:
**Root cause:** Manual file naming inconsistency
- Images uploaded with dashes: `OrderTitle-5.webp`
- Code expected no dashes: `OrderTitle5.webp`

**Prevention:**
- Use consistent naming convention
- Automate image imports
- **OR** Migrate to Sanity CMS for image management

### Missing metadataBase:
**Root cause:** Next.js 15 requirement
- Next.js 15+ requires explicit `metadataBase`
- Needed for absolute URL generation

**Prevention:**
- Always set in root layout
- Use environment variable for flexibility

## 💡 Understanding Render Logs

### Good Patterns to See:
```
✓ Starting...           → App initializing
✓ Ready in XXXXms       → App ready to serve
- Local: http://...     → Listening on port
- Network: http://...   → Internal IP
```

### Warning Patterns:
```
⚠ metadataBase...       → Configuration warning (fixed)
⚠ Slow API response     → Performance issue
⚠ Memory usage high     → Resource concern
```

### Error Patterns:
```
⨯ The requested resource... → 404/Missing file (fixed)
⨯ Failed to fetch...        → API/External error
⨯ Cannot find module...     → Missing dependency
⨯ Unhandled error...        → Code bug
```

## 📞 If Issues Persist

### Debug Steps:
1. **Check Render Dashboard**
   - Go to your Render service
   - Click "Logs" tab
   - Look for new errors

2. **Test Your Site**
   - Visit: https://your-app.onrender.com
   - Check browser console (F12)
   - Test all pages

3. **Verify Deploy**
   - Check Render shows latest commit
   - Verify environment variables still set
   - Check build succeeded

### Common Solutions:
